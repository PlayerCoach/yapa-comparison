Those are scripts that help you create your own dataset.
Make sure to change the paths ( or i will do in incoming commits)

Count unique spekars show you how many uniqe spekars are for given accent, you can add your own accent to the dicotionary in code,
or modify a script like i did with Slavic countries.

Label_script is short script, that makes labeling a lot easier, basicaly you choose an accent, and the script will feed you batch of given size of audio, you delete files you don't want, keep rest, click enter and the audio will be added to your dataset and .tsv file.

Pick_audio is a script if you are feeling lucky with mozzila voices, it just pick audio in given count, it mnakes sure that the speakers are unique, but the dataset itselft is pretty bad in a lot of places, so from my experience i woulnd't recomend it.
